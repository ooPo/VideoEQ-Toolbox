OVERVIEW

	Unfortunately the VideoEQ SDK is only available as a pre-compiled
	library so a very specific environment is required. In this case a
	modern version of MinGW and G++-4.6.2 is sufficient.

INSTRUCTIONS

	1) Install MinGW as normal.

	2) Open the command prompt.

	3) Install gcc-4.6.2:
		
		mingw-get upgrade --recursive "gcc<4.7.*" "g++<4.7.*"

	3) Build the project:

		make clean && make
